Redux Stores the state of ur application.
State of an app is the state represented by all the individual components of that app.

Redux will store and manage the application state.

Application:
state={
    isUserLoggedIn:True;
    username:"Vishwas",
    profile url="",
    onlineUser:[];
    isModalOpened :false
}


Redux is predictable.
Any javascript the state of the application can change.

in redux , all the transitions are explicit and it is possible to keep track of them.

ex:- todo list app- item(pending) --> item(completed)
